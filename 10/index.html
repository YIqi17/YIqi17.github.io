      <h2>What is Synesthesia?</h2>
      <p>Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to
        automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. People who report a lifelong
        history of such experiences are known as synesthetes.In one common form of synesthesia, known as grapheme-
        color synesthesia or color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as inherently colored. 
        In spatial-sequence, or number form synesthesia, numbers, months of the year, or days of the week elicit 
        precise locations in space (for example, 1980 may be "farther away" than 1990), or may appear as a three-
        dimensional map (clockwise or counterclockwise). Synesthetic associations can occur in any combination and 
        any number of senses or cognitive pathways. Little is known about how synesthesia develops. It has been 
        suggested that synesthesia develops during childhood when children are intensively engaged with abstract 
        concepts for the first time. This hypothesis – referred to as semantic vacuum hypothesis – explains why 
        the most common forms of synesthesia are grapheme-color, spatial sequence and number form. These are 
        usually the first abstract concepts that educational systems require children to learn.Only a few types 
        of synesthesia have been scientifically evaluated. Awareness of synesthetic perceptions varies from person 
        to person. Difficulties have been recognized in adequately defining synesthesia. Many different phenomena 
        have been included in the term synesthesia ("union of the senses"), and in many cases the terminology seems 
        to be inaccurate. A more accurate but significantly less common term may be ideasthesia.</p>

      <h1>Grapheme-color synesthesia</h1>
      <p>In one of the most common forms of synesthesia, individual letters of the alphabet and numbers
         (collectively referred to as graphemes) are "shaded" or "tinged" with a color. While different 
         individuals usually do not report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies with 
         large numbers of synesthetes find some commonalities across letters (e.g. A is likely to be red)<a href="animation.html"> Examples</a></p>
      
         <h1>Chromesthesia</h1>
         <p>Another common form of synesthesia is the association of sounds with colors. For some, everyday
            sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or people talking can trigger seeing colors. For 
            others, colors are triggered when musical notes or keys are being played. People with synesthesia 
            related to music may also have perfect pitch because their ability to see/hear colors aids them 
            in identifying notes or keys.<a href="sound.html">  Examples</a></p>

          <h1>Spatial Sequence Synesthesia</h1>
          <p>Those with spatial sequence synesthesia (SSS) tend to see numerical sequences as points in space.
             For instance, the number 1 might be farther away and the number 2 might be closer. People with 
             SSS may have superior memories; in one study, they were able to recall past events and memories 
             far better and in far greater detail than those without the condition. They also see months or 
             dates in the space around them. Some people see time like a clock above and around them.<a href="letterpop.html">  Examples</a></p>

          <h1>Ordinal linguistic Synesthesia</h1>
          <p>Ordinal-linguistic personification (OLP, or personification for short) is a form of synesthesia 
            in which ordered sequences, such as ordinal numbers, week-day names, months and alphabetical 
            letters are associated with personalities or genders (Simner & Hubbard 2006). For example, the 
            number 2 might be a young boy with a short temper, or the letter G might be a busy mother with 
            a kind face. Although this form of synesthesia was documented as early as the 1890s (Flournoy 
            1893; Calkins 1893) researchers have, until recently, paid little attention to this form (see 
            History of synesthesia research).</p>

            <h1>Misophonia</h1>
            <p>Misophonia is a neurological disorder in which negative experiences (anger, fright, hatred, 
              disgust) are triggered by specific sounds. Richard Cytowic suggests that misophonia is related 
              to, or perhaps a variety of, synesthesia.[29] Miren Edelstein and her colleagues have compared 
              misophonia to synesthesia in terms of connectivity between different brain regions as well as 
              specific symptoms. They formed the hypothesis that "a pathological distortion of connections 
              between the auditory cortex and limbic structures could cause a form of sound-emotion synesthesia.<a href="misomia.html">  Examples</a></p>
